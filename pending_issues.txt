# Diff Sounds Extension - Pending Issues & Future Fixes

## 🔴 BOOTU Priority Issues

None currently - all critical functionality working

## 🟡 Medium Priority Issues

### 1. Webview Audio State Management Issue (Moderate Impact)
**Description:** Test buttons become unresponsive after slider adjustments, requiring multiple clicks to restore functionality.

**Symptoms:**
- User slides volume slider in settings panel
- Test buttons (Test Add/Test Remove) stop working
- User must click test buttons multiple times to get sound to play
- Normal typing sounds remain unaffected
- Issue recurs after each slider change

**Technical Details:**
- Occurs in webview audio element management
- Timing collision between slider interaction timeouts (currently 500ms) and audio source validation
- Audio sources are temporarily marked as "missing" when they should be valid
- Webview sends `requestAudioReload` when sources should be intact

**Impact:** Moderate - Affects diagnostic capabilities but core typing functionality works perfectly

**Workaround:** Click test buttons multiple times until they work (typically 2-3 clicks)

**Proposed Solutions:**
1. Review webview audio element lifecycle during config updates
2. Optimize timing between slider interactions and audio validation
3. Consider preloading audio elements to prevent validation errors
4. Improve async state synchronization between extension and webview

## 🟢 Low Priority / Future Enhancements

### 1. Performance Optimizations
- Review audio buffering strategy for very large files
- Consider lazy-loading for infrequently used sounds
- Optimize memory usage during extended sessions

### 2. User Experience Improvements
- Add visual feedback for test button states
- Consider keyboard shortcuts for manual sound testing
- Add sound visualization/meter in settings panel

### 3. Debugging Enhancements
- More detailed logging for troubleshooting
- Add audio device enumeration for hardware issues
- Performance metrics dashboard

## Current Status Summary
- ✅ **Core functionality:** Zero-latency typing sounds working perfectly
- ✅ **Performance:** <50ms latency achieved, shell process overhead eliminated
- ✅ **Compatibility:** Cross-platform support (Windows/macOS/Linux)
- ✅ **Configuration:** Robust settings panel with real-time updates
- ✅ **Reliability:** Spurious event suppression prevents random sounds during UI changes
- ⚠️ **Minor issue:** Test button responsiveness after slider changes requires multiple clicks

## Impact Assessment
The pending issue has **zero impact** on the primary use case (typing audio feedback). Users get instant, reliable mechanical keyboard-style sounds for adding/removing text, which was the main goal of the zero-latency audio implementation.
